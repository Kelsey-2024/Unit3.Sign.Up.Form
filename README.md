## What am I struggling with so far in the boot camp? What do I feel successful at?
  I feel as if I'm confusing all of the languages I've learned thus far, which is somewhat okay because it's only been two months since I've learned everything. I think it was bound to happen. I want to better my design skills too.

## What can I do in this unit to get my closer to my career goals?
  I think I should practice more JavaScript coding so that I can translate it into React.

## What am I most proud of so far in this boot camp?
  As of today, I'm not too sure what I'm proud of.

## How am I spending my work time? Can I do anything to improve my productivity?
  I'm focusing more, maybe it's because I'm on day 5 of React and I'm not spacing out due to confusion.

## What did I learn from this workshop that I can use when searching for jobs or communicating with potential employers?
  

## What aspects of the last unit can I add to my resume? What are my strengths from that unit?
